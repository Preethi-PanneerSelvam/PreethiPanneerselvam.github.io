It encompasses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and
model building, employing regression for pricing optimization
and classification for lead evaluation.
The implementation includes a Streamlit-based GUI for user
interaction, enabling input for predictions and visualization of
model outcomes, along with practical tips for efficient
implementation, including the use of the pickle module and
proper data transformation.

### Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration

ETL Process: Data is extracted from Phonepe's GitHub,
processed using Python algorithms, and loaded into a MySQL
database.
User-friendly EDA: The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
framework enables users to interact with the MySQL database,
filter data with SQL queries, and visualize insights through a
Streamlit dashboard, supported by a detailed user guide.
